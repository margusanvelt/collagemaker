# collagemaker
Short python script that helps fit 4 pictures on a selected canvas.

The program takes a folder and 2 arguments (Canvas_X and Canvas_Y).
If the user does not give the second argument the second argument will be calculated so the aspect ratio will be 2:3 (postcard)


Dependencies:

1. PIL (pillow fork)
